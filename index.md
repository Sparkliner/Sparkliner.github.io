My name is Felipe Constantin Reyes Miftajov. I'm a controls engineer at Dynacraft, a PACCAR Company at McKinney TX. I graduated with a Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University.

I love to solve problems using programming and automation. One of my favorite things to do is to learn new technologies and figure out what I can do with them.

My favorite project to work on when I'm outside of work is my home automation setup using home-assistant.io. It lets me apply real industry technologies such as MQTT to automating tasks around the home and have full control over devices in my home.
