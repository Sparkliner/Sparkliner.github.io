My name is Felipe Constantin Reyes Miftajov. I'm a Master of Engineering student in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University.

I love to solve problems using programming and automation. One of my favorite things to do is to learn new technologies and figure out what I can do with them.

My current project is the [ReadingsBot](https://github.com/Sparkliner/ReadingsBot) Discord Bot, to help automate sharing daily posts from various websites. It's written in C# using the Discord.NET library.
